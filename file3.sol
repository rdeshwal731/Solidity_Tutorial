//Gas is an important concept with Ethereum.
/*
It seems complex, but itâ€™s really just a unit of computation. 
Every transaction that happens occurs at the network level, 
so we have to pay the network its due to complete the computation.

Put simply, gas tells us how much we have to pay for our amazing code to do what it was born to do.
